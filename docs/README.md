## About

This a collection of random notes that I would normally keep on a private
branch, ticketing system, wiki, etc.

Some of these details I'll likely look back at for later refactoring or to
remind myself why a particular design choice was made. The intended audience
is mostly myself, though someone looking for more of the design backstory
might be interested in the content also.

At some point in the future I will likely purge this content and instead use
this path to hold project documentation, such as example content currently
located in the main README file.
